## Programming languages

History of programming languages:

One day, in a virtual world, four programming languages met — C, Python, Java, and JavaScript.

C, being the oldest, proudly started talking about his younger days. "Back in my day, I programmed everything by myself! I have the best performance, and anyone who doesn’t know C, doesn’t know real programming!" he said, proudly clutching his pointer.

Python, with a smile, replied, "Of course, C, but I’m way more versatile. I can do almost anything! And my syntax is so clean and enjoyable, no one wants to go back to C after writing my elegant lines of code."

Java, known for her unwavering confidence, chuckled. "Ha! Versatility is one thing, but who has the strongest architecture? Me! You can rely on me for any app — mobile or enterprise — I’m everywhere!"

JavaScript, sitting in the corner and looking at some random stuff on the screen, yawned and said, "Yeah, yeah, you all have your superpowers, but who rules the browsers? Me! When a page has an issue, I’m the one who fixes it… unless, of course, someone accidentally makes a mistake in my code…”

Everyone looked at him with uncertainty.

"So, JavaScript, why are you sitting in the corner?" asked C.

"Me?" replied JavaScript, straightening up. "Well… I’m never 100% sure what’s going on. Sometimes I work, sometimes I blow up. But… hey! That’s why people love me!"

"Then why does everyone have problems with your code?" asked Python.

"Because… because… because… I’m dynamic!" JavaScript answered proudly. "Sometimes… I just… explode!"

And that was the end of the story about the four languages. Each of them had its strengths and quirks, but one thing was certain: in the world of programming, life wouldn’t survive for a minute without them!
